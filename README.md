# Computer Science Research Checklists 

Other fields (pilots, astronauts, doctors) have made very successful use of checklists for managing repeatable tasks (cite Gawande book).
Though they haven't caught on as much in computer science research, there are tasks that we repeat often, and could benefit from checklists to go back to.
As I go through the research process, I'm trying to isolate those tasks and create a set of checklists to help with research in the future.

Currently, the checklists are organized in the following way:

## Research Ideas

A set of checklists used for evaluating and exploring research ideas.

## Papers

A set of checklists used for planning, writing, and submitting papers.
